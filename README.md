# Bidzina Portfolio Website
This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to support my job search and professional development. The site highlights my background in marketing, learning design, program coordination, and applied research, and serves as a central place to share my experience, projects, and contact information.
This is my **first end-to-end web project built with code** that I set up, edited, and deployed myself. The goal of this project was not only to create a clean, professional portfolio, but also to learn the fundamentals of how websites work under the hood — from file structure and styling to deployment and hosting.
## Purpose
- Showcase my professional background and experience
- Provide a simple, fast, and accessible personal website for recruiters and collaborators
- Learn hands-on web development fundamentals using real tools and workflows
## Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure and content  
- **CSS** for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** for basic interactivity  
- **GitHub Pages** for free, static hosting
## What I Learned
- How static websites are structured and deployed
- How to manage and update a project using GitHub
- How content, styling, and behavior are separated across files
- How to publish and maintain a live website without paid hosting platforms

## Notes
This project is intentionally simple and lightweight. It’s designed to be easy to maintain, fast to load, and flexible enough to evolve as my career and skills grow.
